# TRE-MPRA-Pipeline

Welcome to the TRE-MPRA-Pipeline (TMP) github. This code was designed for users to be able to analyze their own fastq after performing MPRA studies using the TRE library from the [English lab](https://www.english.biochem.utah.edu/).

We are currently working on creating a dockerized container to ease the downloading process. When this is finished we will add a link here. 

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/JGEnglishLab/TMP/wiki) for details on setting up and running TMP.
