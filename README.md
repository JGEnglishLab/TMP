Welcome to the TRE-MPRA-Pipeline (TMP) github. This code was designed for users to be able to analyze their own fastq files after performing MPRA studies using the TRE library from the [English lab](https://www.english.biochem.utah.edu/).

If you want to run this analysis, we strongly recommend using our [TRE-MPRA-pipeline-docker](https://github.com/JGEnglishLab/TRE-MPRA-pipeline-docker) code. This will allow you to run the analysis without the need to install the necessary dependencies. 

Again, we <ins>**strongly**</ins> recommend running this pipeline with the docker. However, if you decide to not use docker, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/JGEnglishLab/TMP/wiki) for details on setting up and running this pipeline.
