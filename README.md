# TRE-MPRA-Pipeline

Welcome to the TRE-MPRA-Pipeline (TMP) github. This code was designed for users to be able to analyze their own fastq files after performing MPRA studies using the TRE library from the [English lab](https://www.english.biochem.utah.edu/).

We have created a docker image to help run this pipeline. We recommend installing the docker image in order to run this pipeline. Running this pipeline with docker will allow you to avoid installing all the dependencies. Here is the link to the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/samhimes92/tmp) . In addition to providing the docker, we've also created some "image runner" scripts to help with the somewhat complex commands required to mount local data to the image. Follow this link to access the ["image runner" scripts](https://github.com/JGEnglishLab/TRE-MPRA-pipeline-docker), a small test data set, and instructions for installing the docker image.

We strongly recommend running this pipeline with docker. However, if you decide to not use docker, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/JGEnglishLab/TMP/wiki) for details on setting up and running this pipeline.
